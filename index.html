        <h2>Sophmore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Sophmore at Bob Jones University studying Cinema Production with no minor, but I do take a lot of photography classes. My specialties are in cinematography and lighting.</p>
         <p>
            I spend a lot of my time practicing my craft. I have been obsessed with being a better cinematographer / photographer since i was about 10 years old. When I am not on set, which is rarely, I watch videos and films to learn more.
         </p> 
         <p> 
            I also enjoy going on a drive on backroads with loud music playing.
